II. How to Run the Program

Python environment required:
1. numpy(1.15.4) Used for scientific calculation.
2. pandas(0.23.4) Used to read csv file.
3. scikit-learn(0.20.1) Used for implement machine learning algorithms.
4. matplotlib(3.0.2) Used as  a 2D plotting library for data visualization.

Open a terminal, go to the current path. Type in:
The sample of command for CNN.py:
Python CNN.py

Wait a minute, It will automatically generates accuracy of the test set and the validation set corresponding to the algorithm as well as ROC curve.
